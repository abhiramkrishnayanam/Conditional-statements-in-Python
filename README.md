# Conditional Statements in Python

## Introduction
Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute certain pieces of code based on specific conditions. The primary conditional statements in Python are `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

### Syntax
```python
if condition:
    # Block of code to execute if the condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # Block of code to execute if the previous condition was False but this one is True
else:
    # Block of code to execute if all the above conditions are False

Here I have done some programs using Conditional Statements.
